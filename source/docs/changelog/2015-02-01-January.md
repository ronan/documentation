**PHP Upgrade**  
We upgraded from PHP 5.3 to 5.3.29. This is the [last release](http://php.net/archive/2014.php#id2014-08-14-1) for 5.3 and current users are encouraged, if possible, to [upgrade to 5.5](https://www.getpantheon.com/docs/articles/sites/settings/toggling-between-php-versions/) in your site's Dashboard.

**Concerned about CVE-2015-0235 aka "GHOST"?**  
There's no need. Customer application servers and database servers that were already on up-to-date versions were not vulnerable to GHOST.  Backing services were quickly patched, and our engineers further refined our patch deployment capability for even faster responses to future vulnerabilities.
