##Platform Improvements


**WordPress Launch Check**  
WordPress Launch Check is an automated report you can run to make sure your site is ready to launch—built right in to the Pantheon Dashboard or available as a [WP-CLI plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp_launch_check). [Learn more](https://pantheon.io/blog/announcing-wordpress-launch-check).

**WordPress core Updates to 4.2.1**  
WordPress 4.2 came out this month to great fanfare, [Learn more](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2). A few days later, the core team released a security update. We were on it, and the most recent version is available in all Pantheon WordPress Site Dashboards. We recommend updating all of your WordPress sites as soon as possible. [Learn more](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.1).

**Edge Cache Configuration Update**  
Previously, if you ran a Google AdWords campaign that included a redirect before users landed on your marketing content, your reports included PANTHEON_STRIPPED
in place of the campaign attributes in the original URL.  Now you will no longer experience PANTHEON_STRIPPED normalization in any of your Google Analytics reports.

**SAML Users**  
Single-sign on customers now have a dedicated log in page. Learn more about [SAML For Pantheon Agencies](/docs/articles/organizations/saml-for-orgs).

**Fedora Update**  
We’ve officially completed a fleet-wide codeserver update to [Fedora 20](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Release_Notes/).

**Styx-to-Appserver Encryption**  
We now have encryption for routing to appserver, so if you’re running HTTPS you will automatically have end-to-end encryption on non-free sites.
